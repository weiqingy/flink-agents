     * Whether this connection can apply the provider's native structured-output API for the given
     * model.
     *
     * <p>Capability is <b>model-dependent</b>, not connection-wide: a single provider connection
     * commonly serves both models that accept a native schema parameter and models that do not. The
     * model to ask about is whatever {@link #effectiveModelFor(Map)} returns for the parameters a
     * request would be built from, and a caller outside this class asks that hook and nothing else.
     * Outside this class rather than outside this package: both members are {@code protected}, so a
     * caller further out reaches the question through {@link
     * BaseChatModelSetup#willApplyNativeStructuredOutput(Object)}, which holds a connection and
     * composes the answer on its behalf. Such a caller must not substitute the identifier the
     * request is issued against: on a deployment-based provider the request targets a deployment
     * name the user chose while capability belongs to the model backing it, so the two disagree in
     * both directions.
     *
     * <p>The default {@code false} keeps a connection on the prompt-engineering fallback. A
     * connection that classifies by model name must still report {@code false} for a name it does
     * not recognize. What that buys depends on the configured strategy rather than on this
     * connection: under {@code AUTO} or {@code PROMPT} it degrades to the fallback rather than
     * failing at the provider, while under a forced {@code NATIVE} the schema is sent anyway and
     * the provider answers for it. A connection whose capability belongs to the endpoint rather
     * than to the model answers for the endpoint instead, and may report {@code true} for a name it
     * has never seen.
     *
     * <p>This answer is advisory rather than binding: it is a statement about the model that a
     * configured policy is permitted to overrule, and {@link
     * StructuredOutputStrategy#resolvesToNative(boolean)} is defined to do so in either direction.
     * Feasibility admits no such override, which is why {@link
     * #canApplyNativeStructuredOutput(Object, List, Map)} is a separate hook rather than a further
     * condition folded into this one.
     *
     * @param effectiveModel the model whose capability is being asked about, as returned by {@link
     *     #effectiveModelFor(Map)}, may be null
     * @return true if a schema can be applied natively for {@code effectiveModel}

     * parameter verbatim keeps the capability answer and the request in agreement. A connection
     * that falls back to a configured default model when the parameter is absent applies that

    /**
     * Whether this connection could apply {@code outputSchema} natively to a request built from
     * these tools and parameters, leaving the effective model's capability out of the answer.
     *
     * <p>Feasibility, not capability: the answer covers everything this connection's native branch
     * requires apart from the effective model, including conditions fixed by the connection's own
     * configuration rather than carried by the request, and says nothing about whether the model
     * {@link #effectiveModelFor(Map)} names would honor a native schema, which is the separate
     * question {@link #supportsNativeStructuredOutput(String)} answers. Neither answer bounds the
     * other, in either direction. A POJO on a model the connection does not classify as capable is
     * feasible here and not capable there; a {@code RowTypeInfo} on a connection whose capability
     * predicate is unconditionally true is capable there and not feasible here.
     *
     * <p>This answer is binding rather than advisory, which is the asymmetry that keeps it separate
     * from capability. A request whose schema this connection cannot encode has no native form to
     * send, so no policy can overrule a {@code false} here, whereas a policy is permitted to
     * overrule the capability answer.
     *
     * <p>An override must answer from the same logic its own request builder uses to decide the
     * native branch, so that the answer cannot drift from what the request ends up carrying.
     *
     * <p>A {@code false} answer is not an error: it reports that the request would carry no native
     * schema. What the caller does with that is the configured strategy's to decide — under {@code
     * AUTO} or {@code PROMPT} it keeps the prompt-engineering fallback rather than losing the
     * schema, while under a forced {@code NATIVE} the gate raises rather than falling back, since
     * no request it builds could express the schema. A {@code true} is not a promise that the call
     * succeeds either: a connection may still raise once its native branch has decided to apply the
     * schema, as happens where the caller supplied a response format of its own that conflicts with
     * it.
     *
     * <p>The default {@code false} is safe only for a connection that translates no schema at all.
     * A connection whose request builder has a native branch but which leaves this unoverridden
     * reports every request infeasible: a caller that falls back to the prompt then silently never
     * reaches that branch, and one that refuses an unapplicable schema instead fails on a request
     * the connection could in fact have applied.
     *
     * <p>Answers about the request rather than validating it. A null {@code outputSchema} is an
     * unconstrained request, a null {@code tools} is a request binding no tools, and a null {@code
     * modelParams} is accepted; none of the three may raise. The parameters must be read without
     * being consumed, so that the same map still builds the request the answer was about.

     * <p>{@code outputSchema} is framework-level execution metadata, kept off {@code modelParams}
     * so that it can never reach a provider SDK request as a generation parameter. It is either a
     * POJO {@link Class} or an {@link org.apache.flink.agents.api.agents.OutputSchema} (a {@code
     * RowTypeInfo} wrapper); the two cases are distinguished by the connection that consumes it.
     *
     * <p>A schema must not be handed to a connection that has no native translation for it: this
     * default implementation rejects a non-null {@code outputSchema} rather than dropping it, so an
     * unconstrained response can never be mistaken for a schema-conforming one. A null {@code
     * outputSchema} delegates to {@link #chat(List, List, Map)}. A connection that does translate a
     * schema into a native provider parameter overrides this overload, and reports its capability
     * via {@link #supportsNativeStructuredOutput(String)}.
     *
     * <p>No connection translates an {@link org.apache.flink.agents.api.agents.OutputSchema}, and
     * so a {@code RowTypeInfo}, natively, and what follows differs by connection. One that
     * overrides this overload applies its native parameter only for a POJO {@link Class}, so it
     * skips the {@code RowTypeInfo} and leaves the request unchanged; whether the caller then keeps
     * the prompt-engineering fallback or is refused depends on its configured strategy, since a
     * forced {@code NATIVE} raises at the gate on a schema no request can express. One that does
     * not override it rejects the {@code RowTypeInfo} through the default body above, which refuses
     * every non-null schema alike. The skip is a deliberate, permanent fallback rather than a
     * translation still to be written; the rejection is the separate case of a connection that
     * could otherwise only drop the schema silently.
     *
     * <p>An overriding connection renders a POJO with its provider SDK's own schema generator, and
     * a render failure is not reported here because those generators produce a schema for every
     * class they are handed. The asymmetry with the Python side is imposed by the vendor libraries
     * rather than chosen: Pydantic genuinely raises on a model it cannot express, and the Python
     * connections wrap that. A schema the SDK does render is sent as rendered even when it declares
     * no properties; whether such a document is usable is the receiving provider's to judge.
     *
     * <p>The ReAct prompt path renders through a different generator, Jackson, rather than through
     * any provider SDK, and a POJO Jackson cannot render is rejected there rather than reaching the
     * prompt. Because the two paths use different generators, that rejection says nothing about
     * what a connection does with the same POJO.
