        Capability is *model-dependent*, not connection-wide: a single provider
        connection commonly serves both models that accept a native schema parameter and
        models that do not. The model to ask about is whatever ``effective_model_for``
        returns for the parameters a request would be built from, and a caller outside
        the connection asks that hook and nothing else. Such a caller must not
        substitute the identifier the request is issued against: on a deployment-based
        provider the request targets a deployment name the user chose while capability
        belongs to the model backing it, so the two disagree in both directions.

        The default ``False`` keeps a connection on the prompt-engineering fallback. A
        connection that classifies by model name must report ``False`` for a name it
        does not recognize, so that it degrades to the fallback rather than failing at
        the provider. A connection whose capability belongs to the endpoint rather than
        to the model answers for the endpoint instead, and may report ``True`` for a
        name it has never seen.

        This answer is advisory rather than binding: it is a statement about the model
        that a configured policy is permitted to overrule, and
        ``StructuredOutputStrategy.resolves_to_native`` is defined to do so in either
        direction. Feasibility admits no such override, which is why

        Derived from the parameters a request would be built from. Overriding this is
        how a connection whose effective model is not the ``model`` parameter verbatim
        keeps the capability answer and the request in agreement: a connection that
        falls back to a configured default model when the parameter is absent applies
        that fallback here, and a deployment-based provider returns the model backing
        the deployment rather than the deployment the request targets.

        Answers for whatever it is given rather than validating it: a model that does
        not resolve comes back ``None``, and ``supports_native_structured_output`` must
        accept ``None`` rather than raising. What a ``None`` model resolves to is that

        """Whether this connection could apply ``output_schema`` natively to a
        request built from these tools and parameters, leaving the effective model's
        capability out of the answer.

        Feasibility, not capability: the answer covers everything this connection's
        native branch requires apart from the effective model, including conditions
        fixed by the connection's own configuration rather than carried by the request,
        and says nothing about whether the model ``effective_model_for`` names would
        honor a native schema, which is the separate question
        ``supports_native_structured_output`` answers. Neither answer bounds the other,
        in either direction. A ``BaseModel`` subclass on a model the connection does
        not classify as capable is feasible here and not capable there; a
        ``RowTypeInfo``, which no connection translates natively, on a connection whose
        capability predicate is unconditionally true is capable there and not feasible
        here.

        This answer is binding rather than advisory, which is the asymmetry that keeps
        it separate from capability. A request whose schema this connection cannot
        encode has no native form to send, so no policy can overrule a ``False`` here,
        whereas a policy is permitted to overrule the capability answer.

        An override must answer from the same logic its own request path uses to decide
        the native branch, so that the answer cannot drift from what the request ends up
        carrying.

        A ``False`` answer is not an error: it reports that the request would carry no
        native schema, so the caller keeps the prompt-engineering fallback rather than
        losing the schema. A ``True`` is not a promise that the call succeeds either: a
        connection may still raise once its native branch has decided to apply the
        schema, as happens where the caller supplied a response format of its own that
        conflicts with it.

        The default ``False`` is safe only for a connection that translates no schema at
        all. A connection whose request path has a native branch but which leaves this
        unoverridden reports every request infeasible: a caller that degrades to the
        prompt-engineering fallback then silently never reaches that branch, and one
        that refuses an unapplicable schema instead fails on a request the connection
        could in fact have applied.

        Answers about the request rather than validating it. A ``None``
        ``output_schema`` is an unconstrained request, a ``None`` ``tools`` is a request
        binding no tools, and a ``None`` ``model_kwargs`` is accepted; none of the three
        may raise. The parameters must be read without being consumed, so that the same
        mapping still builds the request the answer was about.

            The schema the response should conform to, or ``None`` for an
            unconstrained response. This is framework-level execution metadata, and
            every implementation must declare it as a named parameter rather than let
            it fall into ``**kwargs``: ``**kwargs`` is forwarded to the provider SDK,
            so a schema landing there would reach the request body.

            An ``OutputSchema`` wraps either a ``BaseModel`` subclass or a
            ``RowTypeInfo``. No implementation translates a ``RowTypeInfo`` natively,
            and what follows differs by implementation: one that translates a
            ``BaseModel`` natively skips the ``RowTypeInfo`` and leaves the request
            unchanged, so the caller keeps the prompt-engineering fallback; one with
            no native translation at all rejects it, as described below. The skip is a
            deliberate, permanent fallback, not a translation still to be written.

            A ``BaseModel`` subclass is refused with a ``TypeError`` naming the schema
            class and chaining the underlying error as its cause, both when it has no
            JSON Schema at all and when it has one that this provider's renderer will
            not accept. The second outcome is per-provider: a model with an untyped
            member renders under Pydantic, and one provider's renderer takes it while
            another refuses it. Neither is raised unless the request was going to
            carry a native schema, since an implementation renders only once it has
            decided to send one — so an unrenderable schema reports nothing when the
            effective model is not one the implementation calls natively capable, or
            when some other condition has already ruled the native branch out.

            A ``BaseModel`` subclass that renders but declares no fields is sent as
            rendered, leaving the receiving provider to accept or refuse it.

            An implementation with no native structured-output translation at all is a
            separate case, not the ``RowTypeInfo`` skip above: it rejects *every*
            non-``None`` schema, ``RowTypeInfo`` included, via
            ``_reject_unsupported_output_schema``, because it could otherwise only
            drop the schema silently. A caller that wants the prompt-engineering
            fallback from such an implementation must pass ``None``.

        Framework-facing rather than a user entry point: a user configures the outcome
        through the structured-output strategy the descriptor carries instead of
        calling this.

        The answer composes what the connection reports about a request of that shape,
        what it reports about the model its own ``effective_model_for`` names for such
        a call, and what the configured strategy makes of the two. Feasibility is asked
        first, about a request binding no tools and the parameters ``model_kwargs``
        returns. Conjoining it is what keeps a capability predicate that answers
        without consulting the schema from resolving a form its own connection has no
        translation for; asking it first is what keeps that predicate and
        ``effective_model_for`` from being consulted about such a form at all, which
        matters because neither contract forbids an override from raising.

        A ``True`` is not a promise that ``chat_structured`` returns a response: a
        connection may still raise once its native branch has decided to apply the
        schema, as happens where the caller supplied a response format of its own that
        conflicts with it, or where the schema renders to no document the provider
        will take. Such a failure is that connection's documented answer and reaches
        the caller as it was raised.

        Answers about a call rather than issuing one: this method sends no request.
        What the connection's hooks do when consulted is their own contracts'
        business.

        Parameters
        ----------
        output_schema : OutputSchema | None
            The schema a call would carry, or ``None`` for an unconstrained call,
            which is never a native one.

            strategy, resolved against the connection's capability for the model its
            own ``effective_model_for`` names for such a call, calls for a native
            schema.

        ------

        Framework-facing rather than a user entry point. It serves the caller that has
        already decided, through ``will_apply_native_structured_output``, that the
        schema should travel natively; a user reaches a model through ``chat``, which
        is where a prompt, prompt arguments and tools belong.

        The messages are sent as given. ``chat`` prepends the bound prompt whenever
        one is bound, whatever prompt arguments it is handed, so a second pass over
        messages that already came through it would repeat that prompt and the
        skill-discovery message with it. Binding no tools is not a caller's choice
        either: a provider may drop a native schema from a request that also
        advertises tools.

        A schema is required. A connection reads a missing one as an unconstrained
        request, so without this check the one method whose purpose is to carry a
        schema would quietly answer without one; ``chat`` is how a caller asks for
        that deliberately.

        A connection may raise from here once its native branch has decided to apply
        the schema, as happens where the caller supplied a response format of its own
        that conflicts with it. Such a failure reaches the caller as it was raised
        rather than becoming an unconstrained response, so what this may raise is not
        limited to the errors listed below.
